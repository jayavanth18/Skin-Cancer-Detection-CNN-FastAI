**A lightweight end-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying dermatoscopic skin lesion images using transfer learning with FastAI and PyTorch.**

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **FastAI** and a **PyTorch backend** to classify skin cancer lesions from dermatoscopic images.

It uses a **ResNet18** model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tunes it on a curated subset of the **Skin Cancer ISIC** dataset.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational & research purposes only**. It is *not* a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to resource and training time constraints, the notebook uses only a **subset of classes** (some classes were removed) from the original dataset.

Of course. Here are the updated parts of the markdown including the TTA accuracy.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🧠 **Transfer Learning** | Pre-trained **ResNet18** model fine-tuned with FastAI best practices. |
| ⚡ **Simplified Workflow** | FastAI abstracts away boilerplate PyTorch code for faster prototyping. |
| 🔄 **Data Augmentation** | Uses `aug_transforms` (flips, rotation, zoom, warp) for generalization. |
| 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation** | Includes **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision-Recall Curve**, and **ROC Curve**. |
| 🎯 **Prediction Demo** | Load the trained model and run single-image predictions with probabilities. |
| 🧪 **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)** | **Achieved 80.68% accuracy** by averaging predictions over augmented images. |
| 📈 **Learning Rate Finder** | Automatically selects the best learning rate with `learn.lr_find()`. |

## 📦 Dataset

We use the publicly available **Skin Cancer ISIC** dataset from Kaggle:
🔗 [Skin Cancer 9 Classes (ISIC) - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic)

**Important Note:**
To reduce training time and manage resources, the notebook does **not use all 9 classes**. One or more classes were **intentionally excluded** during training. You can modify the notebook to include all classes if needed.

## 🧠 Technical Details

* **Model Architecture**: ResNet18
* **Framework**: PyTorch
* **High-Level API**: FastAI
* **Training Strategy**: `fine_tune` + `fit_one_cycle`
* **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision-Recall, ROC-AUC
* **Visualization**: Confusion Matrix, Top Losses, Optimal LR plots
* **Dataset Subsetting**: Some classes from the original ISIC dataset were excluded for practical training duration.
